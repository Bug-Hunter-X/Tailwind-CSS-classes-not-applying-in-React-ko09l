# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in React applications: Tailwind classes not being applied correctly.

## Description
The `bug.js` file contains a React component that attempts to use Tailwind CSS classes for styling a button. However, the button does not render with the expected styles.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem.  The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is properly configured and integrated into the React project. This might involve correctly importing Tailwind styles or ensuring that the necessary build steps are in place to process Tailwind directives.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.
5. Observe that the button in `bug.js` does not have the expected Tailwind styles.
6. Compare the `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` to see how the issue is resolved.
